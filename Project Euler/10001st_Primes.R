# Project Euler Program:
# By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see 
# that the 6th prime is 13.

# Question: What is the 10,001st prime number?

# A prime number is that, that is only divisible by itself and 1.

# Create a list of prime numbers, once the list reaches 10,001, end. 
# 10,001 prime is count.prime_number[-1]
